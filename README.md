## Team name: Opportunities Optimizers

## Problem Statement Title:

### An Interactive Job and Internship Platform for Technical Education Department, Govt. of Rajasthan


## Description

This repository contains the prototype for the Interactive Job and Internship Platform developed for SIH 2024. It includes a Streamlit app showcasing AI-driven job recommendations and a mentorship chat system, aimed at improving the transition from education to employment for graduates. Additionally, early UX/UI designs for the platform are available in this repository.

## Prototype Overview

We've developed:
- **UX/UI Design**: A clear, user-friendly interface.
- **Streamlit App**: A machine learning model prototype for job recommendations and a one-on-one chat session system for mentorship.
- **Mentorship Chat**: One-on-one chat system connecting users with mentors.

## ML model via Streamlit app 

#### You can access our mode by this link https://internovaapp.streamlit.app/
#### or , by Install and run it in your local environmwnt

### Installation and Setup

 To get started with the platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### Using the Platform

Once the app is running, you can explore the following features:



#### **Job Recommendations:**
- Navigate to the **Job Recommendations** section.
- Input your skills, location preferences, and qualifications.
- The ML model will provide personalized job suggestions.
